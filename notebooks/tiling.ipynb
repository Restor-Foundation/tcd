    "Geospatial data can be extremely large while machine learning models are only able to predict small inputs due to memory constraints. Even using a high-end graphics card with > 24 GB of VRAM, predicting larger than 2048 x 2048 px tiles is difficult. As a result, predicting over tiles is the preferred way to process large images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We normally assume that CNNs are translation invariant. Roughly speaking this means that if a feature is fully visible, it should be predicted with similar confidence whether it's at the edge or the centre of the image. In practice this is only true in the centre of a tile, since at the edges the network sees blank data and has less context to make the prediction. To avoid these edge effects, images are tiled in an overlapping fashion with the overap roughly equal to one \"receptive field\" of the network. Empirically, 512 px gives a good result in most cases. This logic doesn't necessarily hold for newer architectures based on Transformers which don't have the same inductive biases as convolutional networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pipeline provides some simple utility functions to generate arbitrary resolution tiles from a source orthomosaic. Since the model is trained at 10 cm/px, we resample imagery to that resolution (nominally) though we also perform some augmentation at prediction-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drone orthomosaics are often much higher quality, at 1-5cm/px so we have to resample. We provide two options:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Resize the image on the fly\n",
    " - Resample the image and store to disk\n",
    " \n",
    "The first option is fast and works if you want to process an image once. If you think you're likely to experiment with different prediction settings, resampling as a one-time process might make more sense. Rescaling on the fly is also approximate and assumes that linear scaling is appropriate (this is normally true, if you look at the transformation from pixels -> world coordinates). You might find that you get different results if you compare both methods, but it shouldn't affect things much.\n",
    " \n",
    "In order to plug in to machine learning pipelines, we provide a `TiledGeoImage` that takes a single image as an input and returns tile \"samples\". You can then iterate over this dataset sequentially to load all the tiles (e.g. you can directly pass it to a dataloader)."

    "The difference here is that we compute the minimum number of tiles required (again, 3) and distribute the tiles across the range. This has less of an impact for very large images, but you may find you prefer results from one approach over the other. The main advantage of this tiling strategy is that you don't need to worry about an odd-shaped tile at the edge of the image. It also provides more overlap for each tile, which may produce better predictions in those regions, but also requires some additional logic when merging results as the \"requested\" overlap isn't necessarily what the tiler will give you."
